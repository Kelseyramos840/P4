        <h2>Good Times</h2></div> 
        <P>There are many cons and pros of being a student athlete. Here's a moment of college I will never forget. 
</P>
        <P>Sophomore year of college, playing soccer, we were having a decent season. The team was close and having fun. Couple wins, couple loses, couple ties. Nothing crazy. Conference is when it's do or die. This is where you need to win the games in order to make the conference tournament. The year before we just scraped by. We had played a couple of conference games and we knew these last three games we needed to win. On a sunday afternoon, we went up north to play Vermont women's soccer. I wasn't having a great start to the game,I started to get in my head a little bit. That's not like me at all, so I was starting to get nervous. Then one second I get the ball and I shut my mind off and just let my body do the job it's known since it was 4 years old. I ripped the ball from outside of the box, not a great shot but it went to the back corner and my teammates had my back and taped it into the goal. That boosted my confidence back to normal. I felt this was going to be a good game. We go into halftime 1-0 us. Second half starts and Vermont scores within the first 10 minutes. Then my teammates, the same one scores again to give us a lead, it's now 2-1. Vermont comes back 5 minutes later and scores again, making it 2-2. There's now 10-15 minutes in the half and my one teammate subs on the field. I tell her, “send the ball through the two center backs, I'll get there”. My teammate, her first touch coming back in, wins that ball and sends it exactly where I said to. I beat the defender and goalie to the ball and sent it to the back corner. Now we're 3-2. The last 5 minutes of the game I became an outside back to help us not get scored on. After we won the game, we went to the locker room as a team and celebrated with our favorite song then and saw on the conference's instagram that we clinched to playoffs. After we celebrated more, we got ice cream at Ben and jerrys, the original in vermont. I've had many great moments from college soccer, but this one will forever be the best.</P>
