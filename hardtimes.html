        <h2>Hard Times</h2></div> 
        <p>This is the side of college sports that people don't see often<p>

<p>My sophomore year spring semester I was out for 4 months for a shin injury. However, I was named captain due to how much I brought to the team when I was out and when I was playing. I was so excited to lead this team as a junior. Fast forward to junior fall. This is when we are in season, the beginning of the season is going amazing. We were playing really well and getting good results. Then our third game of the season, we lost. We went on a losing and tying streak. Within that time, I was a 90 minute winger and I was trying to dig this team out of a hole. I never asked for help and I made sure no one knew I was upset. I tried leading them in all different ways. Being hard on them, being relatable, listening to everyones problems. You name it, I tried.</p>
    <p>While all this is happening, I started tearing both of my plantar fasciitis. I played through it, I was in so much pain and I ended up tearing ligaments in both of my ankles due to how much I was overcompensating for them. Even through all of that I played for 3 months with them tearing and rolling. I was getting shots in my feet every other week after the medication would wear off. I was in a boot almost everyday until I had to put my cleats on. I couldn't walk from the lobby to my room without it. Some days I was on crutches and by the end of the season when I finally came to terms with it, I broke down with my athletic trainer. I was in so much physical pain that I couldn’t handle being in emotional pain as well. I was trying to carry everyone else on my back, when in reality, I was the one that needed to be carried. It took me 7 months of rest to finally start practicing again. This is the side people don't usually see. When they see the comeback that happens after this, which is a chapter I’m excited about.</p>
