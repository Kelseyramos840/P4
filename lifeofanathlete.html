        <P>Being a student athlete is a unique experience, itâ€™s more work than people would think. From early morning workouts, to late night studying, making connections with teammates, then competing. The expectations are very high and they need to be met. You are expected to represent the team the best you can in the classroom and on the field.</P>
        <P>Being a student athlete may look different at other schools but they all have one thing in common. There are standards that need to be met. Most athletes have practice early mornings, they can be anywhere from 5am to 8am starts. Then depending on the student's schedule, they may have class right after. Classes can go from after practice til late at night. In college, you most likely have 3 or less classes a day, sound easy right. These classes are hard work, once you're done with class you need to get a head start on work. If you're in season, you will most likely be traveling or have games on school days. Meaning you need to time manage and be ahead of the schedule. Weeks are also the same, practice and school work.</P>
        <P> With that being said, having a social life is still allowed. Being on a team, you make best friends with people very quickly. Depending on how close your team is. You will be spending every second with them and have the same schedule so everything works out. You will most likely be living with your teammates or other student athletes. As long as you balance school and soccer well, there will be no problem with having a social life.</P>
